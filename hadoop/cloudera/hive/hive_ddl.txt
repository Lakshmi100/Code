//if the tables are already there , drop tables , make sure they are previous external
//tables , before dropping them, otherwise u loose the data.
//Managed tables when dropped , will delete the data associated with it in HDFS
//So always create EXTERNAL tables, so ur HDFS data for hive is still there

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE products
STORED AS AVRO
LOCATION 'hdfs:///user/hive/warehouse/retail_stage.db/products'
TBLPROPERTIES('avro.schema.url'='hdfs://quickstart.cloudera/user/cloudera/retail_stage/products.avsc')

//also below will work

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE products
STORED AS AVRO
LOCATION 'hdfs://quickstart.cloudera/user/hive/warehouse/retail_stage.db/products'
TBLPROPERTIES('avro.schema.url'='hdfs://quickstart.cloudera/user/cloudera/retail_stage/products.avsc')
